To Do
-----

* implement table-based hand_score formula, determine criteria for biddable hand,
  both first round (based on turncard) and second round
* command-line for testing/tweaking hand_score params
* encapsulate all scoring/analysis functions into classes (define separate base class
  per phase of game)
* output ML data stream (include max hand_score seen)
* classes for play rules/strategy
* config for bidding/playing classes should be by team
* decouple bidding algorithm/class from scoring formula(s) (i.e. scoring is parameterized)
